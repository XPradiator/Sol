  # Solidity
  The code which i have submitted here was learned from metacrafters.
  # Public variables
  The code starts with assigning the name and abbreviation of the token using string variable.
  # Mapping variable
  The mapping of the variable is conducted in the second part of the program. this simply means that if the address is given by any user it should display back the balance amount of tokens. 
  # Mint function
  The mint function in is used to add or generate more tokens to the total supply of that token.
  # Burn function
  The burn function is used to burn or destroy the tokens from the total supply.
  Also an 'if'is provided inorder to avoid burning tokens more than the total supply.
